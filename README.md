This project is a visually appealing and fully responsive Netflix Clone Frontend built using modern web technologies such as  HTML, CSS, and . It closely replicates the UI of Netflix's homepage, featuring a sleek navigation bar with scroll effects, a dynamic banner highlighting popular content, and multiple horizontally scrollable sliders showcasing trending, top-rated, action, comedy, and other categories. Users can browse movies and shows with an intuitive layout and enjoy smooth hover effects that reveal additional information. The interface includes a functional search bar, is optimized for all screen sizes—desktop, tablet, and mobile—and provides a near-authentic Netflix user experience purely from a frontend perspective.
